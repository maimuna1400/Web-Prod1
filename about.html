            <h1>I graduated from <span class="word_mark">CUNY Hunter College</span> as a <span class="word_mark">Emerging Media major and Computer Science minor</span>. I am a <span class="word_mark">full time video editor</span> and <span class="word_mark">part time designer</span>. I have been editing videos <span class="word_mark">since high school</span>. It started as a fun hobby and slowly I became more serious about it. And my love for video editing kept growing ever since. Besides, I have also been <span class="word_mark">designing</span> small icons and logos as well as posters, business/invitation cards, banners and product labels, since high school. I started learning and practicing <span class="word_mark">user experience and interface designing</span> in my sophomore year in college. It is something I really <span class="word_mark">love and enjoy </span>to do and hope to get better at in future.</h1>

            <h1><span class="word_mark">Enjoying every moment</span> of each day is my life's motto. I aim to <span class="word_mark">appreciate the little things</span> everyday, which at the end brings me greater joy. As a result, <span class="word_mark">photography</span> is something that I hold close to my heart as it helps me capture those <span class="word_mark">beautiful moments in life</span>. Besides loving being a video editor and a designer, I also <span class="word_mark">love to paint</span> sometimes whether it is acrylic, oil, or even <span class="word_mark">digital painting</span>. </h1>

I wish I could also float around in water all day...<br> Did you know otters are from the <span class="word_mark">same family as the wolverines</span>? That's a scary relative to have for a small, cute creature.</h1>
